# Welcome to My CS-499 ePortfolio

Hello! I am **Duane Wegner**, a Computer Science student at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). This ePortfolio showcases my projects, skills, and achievements as part of my **CS-499 Capstone**.

Completing my coursework in the **Computer Science** program at **Southern New Hampshire University** and developing my ePortfolio has been a transformative experience that has helped me showcase my technical strengths, shape my professional goals, and prepare to enter the field of computer science as a competent and employable developer. Over the past two years, I have gained hands-on experience across multiple programming languages including **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, and Java**. These experiences have allowed me to develop a strong foundation in software engineering principles, algorithms, data structures, and database design, which I have applied in both academic and practical projects.

Throughout the program, I have developed the ability to collaborate effectively in team environments, using version control systems to coordinate work, manage branches, and integrate code with peers. I have also strengthened my communication skills by documenting project requirements, writing technical reports, and providing clear explanations of complex concepts. These experiences have reinforced my ability to translate technical knowledge into actionable solutions that are understandable to both technical and non-technical audiences.

In addition to the projects featured in my ePortfolio, I have completed several other technical projects that have further developed my skills. I created an Android inventory application that tracks items dynamically, demonstrating my ability to work with mobile interfaces, implement object-oriented design, and manage data structures efficiently. In another project, I developed a 3D image rendering of a desk, which allowed me to explore computational graphics, coordinate transformations, and visual representation of objects. I have also gained practical experience working with both SQL and NoSQL databases, designing and implementing persistent storage solutions for multiple applications. These experiences provided a solid foundation in database management, data modeling, and efficient data retrieval.

My work with data structures and algorithms has strengthened my ability to design and implement efficient, scalable, and reliable solutions. I have created dynamic inventory systems, implemented pathfinding algorithms for game exploration, and optimized navigation and storage mechanisms. These experiences have improved my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities, which are essential for any professional in computer science.

Software engineering and database management have been central to my development as a programmer. I have designed modular and maintainable code architectures, implemented interactive front-end interfaces, and integrated persistent data storage systems. Security has been an ongoing focus, and I have applied defensive coding practices, secure storage techniques, and validation methods to mitigate potential vulnerabilities, reinforcing a security-conscious approach to software design.

The artifacts included in my ePortfolio reflect a progression of skills and demonstrate a range of competencies that work together to illustrate my capabilities. Whispering Woods highlights my ability to convert a Python text-based game into a web-based interactive application, showcasing my skills in **software engineering, algorithmic design, data structures, and database integration**. Each enhancement demonstrates growth in modular coding, scalability, and secure data management, providing concrete evidence of my technical expertise. Together, these artifacts form a cohesive portfolio that presents a comprehensive view of my abilities and readiness to contribute effectively in a professional setting.

This professional self-assessment serves as an introduction to my ePortfolio and illustrates my strengths as a computer science professional. It emphasizes my ability to collaborate, communicate, design efficient solutions, implement software and database systems, and maintain secure practices. The artifacts that follow provide tangible examples of these skills in action and collectively demonstrate my preparedness to meet the demands of a career in computer science.

This video walks through my CS-499 capstone artifact, WhisperingWoods.py a text based console game, highlighting key features, design decisions, and implementation details. It demonstrates how the code functions, the technologies used, and the what improvements will be made throughout my enhancment development.

## Artifact

The artifact I selected is the Python text adventure developed in IT 140. The original source, Artifact File/Whispering-Woods.py, early 2024, served as the foundation for the project enhancement 1. During the CS 499 Capstone in late 2025, I converted this console-based game into a static web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The enhancement includes key files such as game.html, index.html, css/styles.css, data/rooms.json, and multiple JavaScript modules in the js/ directory. The enhanced version represents a fully modernized, deployable, and interactive version of the original game.
