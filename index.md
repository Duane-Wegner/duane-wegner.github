This video walks through my CS-499 capstone artifact, WhisperingWoods.py a text based console game, highlighting key features, design decisions, and implementation details. It demonstrates how the code functions, the technologies used, and the what improvements will be made throughout my enhancment development.

## Artifact

The artifact I selected is the Python text adventure developed in IT 140. The original source, Artifact File/Whispering-Woods.py, early 2024, served as the foundation for the project enhancement 1. During the CS 499 Capstone in late 2025, I converted this console-based game into a static web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The enhancement includes key files such as game.html, index.html, css/styles.css, data/rooms.json, and multiple JavaScript modules in the js/ directory. The enhanced version represents a fully modernized, deployable, and interactive version of the original game. 

## Enhancements

### One (Software Design and Engineering)

### The artifact was improved from the original Python version in several ways:

  -	A visual map layer with fog-of-war logic implemented in map.js and styled in css/styles.css.
  -	Inventory UI with SVG icons created in inventory.js.
  -	UX improvements including modal behavior and keyboard navigation managed in js/main.js.
  -	Expanded documentation in README.md and inline comments across modules.

### Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement?
-	Outcome 1 - Professional self-presentation: Met by creating a professional GitHub repository: This first enhancement can be viewed at: https://duane-wegner.github.io/Whispering-Woods/index.html, and the repository is available at https://github.com/Duane-Wegner/Whispering-Woods/tree/Enhancement-1. 
-	Outcome 2 - Professional communication: Met through README.md and clear in-file comments, demonstrating clear documentation and user communication.
-	Outcome 3 - Algorithmic design and problem solving: Met via map.js and js/game.js, which implement fog-of-war logic, coordinate normalization, and item pickup mechanics.
-	Outcome 4 - Use of modern tools and techniques: Met by using ES modules, modular UI files, and a namespaced persistence approach (js/storage.js).
-	Outcome 5 - Security mindset: Partially met. Admin authentication is local-only (auth.js), and the README.md documents the threat model and limitations.
